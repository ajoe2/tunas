# Tunas contributing guide!
Welcome to the tunas contributing guide! Here are some guidelines on how to contribute to this project.

## Getting started
We use issues to track bugs, new features, and other enhancements. If you find a new bug or would like to implement a new feature, please create a new issue. 

To contribute to the project, simply look through the list of open issues and find one that you would like to work on (or create a new one). Once you finish implementing the update, you can make a PR to merge it into the main branch of the repository.
